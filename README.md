### Problem Statement: Develop a tool that can monitor ground personnel and police officers during bandobast duties by using RFID tags to track their movements and create a platform to monitor them.

# Solution:
The solution involves the use of RFID technology to track the movements of ground personnel and police officers during bandobast duties. RFID tags will be assigned to each individual, and RFID readers will be installed at strategic locations to track their movements. The data collected from the RFID readers will be transmitted to a centralized platform, where it can be monitored in real-time.

# Tech Stack:

1. RFID tags: These are small, lightweight devices that can be attached to individuals.
2. RFID readers: These are devices that can read the data stored on RFID tags.
3. Microcontroller: This device will control the RFID readers and transmit the data to the centralized platform.
4. Centralized Platform: This is a web-based platform that will receive and process the data from the microcontroller.
5. Front-end Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to develop the user interface for the platform.
6. Back-end Technologies: Node.js and MongoDB will be used to develop the back-end of the platform.

# How our app works:
1. Assign RFID tags to individuals.
2. Install RFID readers at strategic locations.
3. RFID readers track the movements of individuals.
4. Data collected from RFID readers is transmitted to the microcontroller.
5. Microcontroller transmits the data to the centralized platform.
6. Centralized platform receives and processes the data.
7. Data is displayed on the user interface.

# Use Cases:
1. Police officers on bandobast duty can be tracked to ensure they stay at their assigned posts.
2. Ground personnel can be tracked to ensure they are following safety protocols and staying within designated areas.
3. Emergency response teams can be tracked to ensure they are responding to incidents quickly and efficiently.
